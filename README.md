Hey so a couple of things before I actually start on creating the website... that's right - PLANNING~ 

I know that a lot of the subjects I want to include on here won;t be super cohesive. I want this to remain more of a professional portfolio than an elevated instagram page. However, I would like to include:\
- a blog (perhaps with a travel component, real estate, fashion, one of a bunch of my interests)
- projects I'm working on. can i include crochet?
- e-commerce directory, if possible! so people can buy my lightroom presets online without having to go to etsy
